# Earth Points

### Environmentally-Friendly Travel Rewards. Earn points based on your mode of transit.  

Whether the consumerâ€™s goal is cost, environment, or efficiency, our solution is to provide consumers with the information and incentives to make informed decisions that positively impact the environment. The final build of the application will compile various transportation options, their cost, environmental impact, ETA of each option, and an incentive to take one over the other. For example, when I tell the application that I would like to go from Georgia Tech to the Atlanta Airport, it will provide me with the different choices I could take to get from point A to point B. From there, I can choose which transportation method I would like - Uber, Marta, biking, walking or a combination of modes. To encourage environmentally friendlier options, the application will recommend choosing the transportation option with the least environmental impact and provide an incentive to take it. 

Currently, our demo has the information aspect down; we have compiled various transportation options from different providers into a single interface, making data available to the consumers right at their fingertips. After choosing the starting location and final destination, the application will provide the user with monetary cost, environmental cost, and time for each of the transportation choices. Future demos will incorporate our incentivization system, where we also inform the user of what benefits they would be missing out on by ignoring the incentives we provide.

### Problem Statement

In the US, 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions are due to cars. Currently, there is minimal incentive for Americans to diverge from this primary mode of transportation to more environmentally friendly options. Additionally, with a growing number of transportation services such as rideshare and rentable scooters, it becomes difficult for the user to find all of their options quickly and efficiently. With our app all of the data from these different services is compiled into one place for quick and easy access.
